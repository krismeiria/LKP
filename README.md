# LKP Lembaga Kursus dan Pelatihan (Indonesia Vocational Data Collection)
This project collects and structures data on Lembaga Kursus dan Pelatihan (LKP) across Indonesia from the official portal:
https://kursus.kemendikdasmen.go.id

The workflow consists of:

  Web scraping publicly available institutional profiles and attributes.
  
  OCR-based document processing of attached SK Operasional files to extract licensed program information from scanned documents.
  
  LLM-powered classification, where extracted program descriptions are standardized and clustered into 10 predefined program categories for consistent aggregation and executive-level reporting.
  
  Data transformation and consolidation into a structured, analytics-ready dataset.
  
  The curated dataset serves as the backend data source for interactive Tableau dashboards, enabling visualization of LKP distribution, program portfolios, regional patterns, and high-level category insights to support monitoring and strategic analysis of vocational training institutions nationwide.
